//! Hook trait — lifecycle backend for agent building, event observation,
//! and tool schema registration.
//!
//! All hook crates implement this trait. [`Runtime`](crate) calls these
//! methods at the appropriate lifecycle points. `DaemonEnv` composes
//! multiple Hook implementations by delegating to each.
