//! Hook trait — lifecycle callbacks for agent building, event observation,
//! and preprocessing.
//!
//! All hook crates implement this trait. The runtime calls these methods
//! at the appropriate lifecycle points. Non-persistence methods default
//! to no-ops so implementors only override what they need.
