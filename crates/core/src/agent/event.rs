//! Agent event types for step-based execution and streaming.

//! Two-level design:
//! - [`AgentStep`]: data record of one LLM round (response + tool dispatch).
//! - [`AgentEvent`]: fine-grained streaming enum for real-time UI updates.
//! - [`AgentResponse`]: final result after a full agent run.
//! - [`AgentStopReason`]: why the agent stopped.
