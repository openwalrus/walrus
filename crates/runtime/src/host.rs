//! Host — trait for server-specific capabilities.
//!
//! The runtime crate defines this trait. The daemon implements it to provide
//! event broadcasting, MCP bridge management, and layered instruction
//! discovery. Embedded users get [`NoHost`] with no-op defaults.
//!
//! Tool dispatch and session state (CWD overrides, pending asks) are NOT
//! part of this trait — they use shared state captured by handler factories.
