//! Pluggable KV storage backend.
//!
//! Runtime subsystems (memory, skills, sessions, agents, event bus, cron)
//! persist state through the [`Storage`] trait instead of reaching for
//! `std::fs` directly. The runtime crate defines the contract; the daemon
//! (or any other consumer) provides a concrete implementation — the
//! default is `daemon::storage::FsStorage`.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! Four methods: [`get`](Storage::get), [`put`](Storage::put),
//! [`delete`](Storage::delete), [`list`](Storage::list). Keys are flat
//! `/`-separated strings owned by the caller (e.g. `memory/entries/<id>.md`,
//! `agents/<ulid>/prompt.md`). Values are bytes — callers handle their own
//! UTF-8, TOML, or JSON decoding.
//!
//! The trait is synchronous. Runtime subsystems already block on
//! small-file I/O from async contexts; forcing an async-trait boundary
//! here would propagate `.await` through many call sites for no benefit.
//! An async variant can land as a separate concern if a backend ever
//! needs it.
