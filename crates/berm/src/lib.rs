//! Crabtalk's side of berm.
//!
//! berm knows how to run a harness and nothing else. It serves no system
//! harness of its own — not the machine, and certainly not an agent or a
//! `ClientMessage` — because every one of those is a decision about a host, and
//! the same sandbox runs elsewhere. This crate is every such decision Crabtalk
//! makes:
//!
//! - [`BermHarness`], which surfaces a harness's tools to the runtime and
//!   dispatches calls to them
//! - [`fs`], [`exec`], [`Http`] and [`Protocol`], the implementations behind the
//!   `crabtalk` namespace — [`berm::Harness`] values, which is all an embedder
//!   ever hands over
//! - `call`, which answers berm's own `berm.call` so one harness can reach
//!   another. berm names it and serves it for nobody: a [`berm::Berm`] is a
//!   single harness with nothing to dispatch to, so a host running more than
//!   one is what registers it
//!
//! The split is what makes "berm is embeddable without crabtalk" a fact the
//! compiler checks rather than a promise: berm's dependency list has no
//! crabtalk crate in it, and cannot grow one without this file moving.
