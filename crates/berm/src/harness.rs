//! Harness tools, as the runtime sees them.
//!
//! Their tools land in the agent's list under their own names, read from the
//! manifest at load — the per-agent declaration is already the gate, so there
//! is no meta-tool to go through (RFC 0205).
//!
//! An image is keyed by what determines it — the ELF, the arguments bounding
//! it, and the scope its runtime doors close over — not by the agent that
//! declared it. The argument still decides: two agents installing the same
//! ELF against different roots hash differently and get two linkers. But two
//! that declare it identically share one image, and a rename changes nothing
//! about the key, because the agent's name was never part of it.
//!
//! Entering a harness blocks the thread it runs on, and `exec` can hold it for
//! the length of a command, so dispatch hands the invocation to the blocking
//! pool rather than running it on an async worker.
