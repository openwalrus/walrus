//! The backend a general install runs.

//! Which store to use is a deployment decision, and storage engines are
//! heavy, so both live here rather than in `crabtalk-store`: a runtime

//! and everything built on it — agents, sessions, memory, skills,
//! harnesses, and BM25 search across them — against five methods, and
//! this is those five methods over [`CrabDb`].
//!
//! One file per realm, so a realm is a thing you can copy, move, or
