# P1-04: Add Skill Struct and SkillTier

## Goal

Define Skill data struct and SkillTier enum in walrus-core. Pure data — parsing and
registry logic live in walrus-runtime (Phase 2).

## Depends On

None.

## Design Decisions

- Skill is a struct, not a trait. All skills have the same shape.
- No serde derives in walrus-core. Populated by SkillRegistry parser in runtime.
- `priority` is u8 (0-255, higher wins).

## Files

- **CREATE** `crates/core/src/skill.rs`
- **MODIFY** `crates/core/src/lib.rs` — add mod, re-export Skill, SkillTier

## Types

- **Skill**: name, description, version, tags (`Vec<String>`), triggers (`Vec<String>`), tools (`Vec<String>`), priority (u8), body (String). Derives: Debug, Clone.
- **SkillTier**: Bundled < Managed < Workspace. Derives: Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, PartialOrd, Ord.

## Tests

- `skill_tier_ordering` — verify Bundled < Managed < Workspace

## Done When

- [ ] `cargo check --workspace` passes
- [ ] Skill and SkillTier re-exported from walrus-core
