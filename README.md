> [!WARNING]
> **Heavy refactor in progress.** The CLI is being redesigned and is not in
> the tree yet. Crate layout and APIs are moving with it — treat anything
> written about internals as out of date until this settles.

**Agent daemon.** Runs agents, dispatches tools, connects to MCP servers.
Start it, talk to it, extend it with packages.

```bash
cargo install crabup   # the version manager
crabup install         # crabtalk itself
crabtalkd              # run the daemon
```

See the [installation guide][install] for details.

Config reference: [`crates/store/src/config/`](crates/store/src/config/).

## How It Works

The daemon owns no tools of its own. Shell, file access, skills and session
search are [harnesses](docs/src/spec/harness.md) an agent declares — one RV64
ELF each, reaching only what that declaration granted. MCP is a capability,
not a harness: calling another program is not shaping an agent.

[Apps](apps/) are agent-powered experiences and standalone services
built on top of the daemon — independent binaries that connect via
auto-discovery.
