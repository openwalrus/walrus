**Agent daemon.** Runs agents, dispatches tools, connects to MCP servers.
Start it, talk to it, extend it with plugins.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://crabtalk.ai/install.sh | sh
```

Or `cargo install crabtalk`. See the [installation guide][install] for details.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start chatting (daemon starts automatically)
crabtalk
```

Full config reference: [`crates/daemon/config.toml`](crates/daemon/config.toml).

## How It Works

The daemon ships with built-in tools (shell, task delegation, memory),
MCP server integration, and skills (Markdown prompt files).

Heavier capabilities live outside the daemon as [plugins](plugins/) —
independent binaries that connect via auto-discovery. [Apps](apps/)
are agent-powered experiences built on top of the daemon.
