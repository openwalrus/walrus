**Agent daemon.** Runs agents, dispatches tools, connects to MCP servers.
Start it, talk to it, extend it with components on PATH.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://crabtalk.ai/install.sh | sh
```

Or `cargo install crabtalk`. See the [installation guide][install] for details.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start the daemon
crabtalk daemon start

# Chat with your agent
crabtalk attach
```

Full config reference: [`crates/daemon/config.toml`](crates/daemon/config.toml).

## How It Works

The daemon ships with built-in tools (shell, task delegation, memory),
MCP server integration, and skills (Markdown prompt files).

Heavier capabilities live outside the daemon as [components](apps/) —
independent binaries that connect via auto-discovery.
