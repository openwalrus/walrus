**The composable agent runtime.** Compact daemon core. Memory, channels,
tools — all hooks. Use what you need, skip what you don't.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://crabtalk.ai/install.sh | sh
```

Or `cargo install crabtalk`. See the [installation guide][install] for details.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start the daemon
crabtalk daemon start

# Chat with your agent
crabtalk attach
```

Full config reference: [`crates/daemon/config.toml`](crates/daemon/config.toml).

## How It Works

Crabtalk is a daemon that runs agents and dispatches tools. The daemon
ships with built-in tools (shell, task delegation, memory), MCP server
integration, and skills (Markdown prompt files).

Heavier capabilities live outside the daemon as components — independent
binaries that install as system services and connect via auto-discovery
(`crabtalk <name>` finds `crabtalk-<name>` on PATH):

| Component    | What it does                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Search       | Meta-search aggregator                |
| Telegram     | Telegram gateway                      |
| WeChat       | WeChat gateway                        |
| Outlook      | Outlook MCP server (email + calendar) |
| Hub          | Package management                    |

The daemon stays small. Components run independently.
