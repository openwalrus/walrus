//! Skills as a harness: discovery, matching, and loading.
//!
//! It reaches the runtime and never the machine. Where skill files live is the
//! daemon's business — packages install them, and `resolve_dirs` walks them —
//! so this harness asks over the protocol rather than holding a read grant
//! spanning the config and home directories to find them itself.
//!
//! The catalogue is not injected into the system prompt. Listing costs a tool
//! call when the model wants one, rather than a tax on every request that
//! grows with the number of skills installed.

// `no_std` and `no_main` are the harness's shape. Off its target this is an
// ordinary binary so `cargo test` can run the tools below natively.
#![cfg_attr(target_arch = "riscv64", no_std, no_main)]
